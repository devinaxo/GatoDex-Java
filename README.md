  <a>A sort of registry (PokeDex if you will) that you can fill with cats you meet (yes, in real life)!</a>

  <a>A little app made with much love, made as a fun passion project to register the many streetcats I meet and feed everyday <s>and also to show myself that I could do it</s>. Intended for personal use, but thought why shouldn't I at least upload it? Maybe people who are better at coding than me can give me a tip on how to get better every once in a while, or someone can get a laugh out of reading my gibberish, anyway it's a win for me.</a>
